B. Korrespondenzen, wie sie in der Rubrik\n    Briefe archiviert und kategorisiert werden) verifiziert.\n    Schlagworthafte Kurzinformationen zu relevanten Personen dienen der\n    besseren Übersicht über Kontakte und das soziale Umfeld des Komponisten.\n\n\n\n\nKurz-Biographie\n\n\n    Am 3. Dezember 1883 in Wien geboren, wuchs Anton Webern in Wien, Graz und Klagenfurt sowie auf dem väterlichen Gut\n    Preglhof in Kärnten auf. In Klagenfurt, wo er auch das humanistische Gymnasium besuchte, erhielt er seine erste\n    musikalische und musiktheoretische Ausbildung und sammelte praktische Erfahrung als Cellist im örtlichen\n    Konzertvereinsorchester. Ab dem Herbstsemester 1902 studierte Webern Musikwissenschaft im von Guido Adler geleiteten\n    musikwissenschaftlichen Institut in Wien, wo er 1906 mit einer Dissertation zu Heinrich Isaacs\n    Choralis Constantinus abschloss. 1904–1908 war er Kompositionsschüler Arnold Schönbergs, dem er zeitlebens\n    eng verbunden blieb. Versuche einer Karriere als fest engagierter Dirigent an diversen Musiktheatern (Teplitz, Bad\n    Ischl, Danzig, Stettin, Prag) scheiterten.\n\n\n\n    Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg unterrichtete Webern Privatschüler in Musiktheorie und Komposition und arbeitete u. a. als\n    Vortragsmeister beim Verein für musikalische Privataufführungen (1918–1922), als Klavierlehrer und Chorleiter am\n    Israelitischen Blindeninstitut in Wien (1925–1931) oder übernahm (in seinen letzten Lebensjahren) auch Aufgaben als\n    Arrangeur fremder Werke für die Universal Edition.\n\n\n\n    Als Dirigent verschiedenster Chöre und Orchester (z. B. des Wiener Schubertbundes, des Mödlinger\n    Männergesangvereins, der Arbeiter-Symphoniekonzerte der Sozialdemokratischen Kunststelle in Wien) wurde er in den\n    Zwanziger- und Dreissigerjahren einem breiteren Publikum bekannt. Ab 1927 dirigierte er im Wiener Rundfunk, wo er\n    zwischen 1930 und 1939 noch als Lektor und Zensor arbeitete. Seine Tätigkeit als Dirigent im Inland endete\n    allerdings 1934 nach dem Dollfuß-Putsch. Wenige Auslandsengagements führten ihn ab 1929 mehrfach nach London sowie\n    nach Deutschland.\n\n\n\n    Weberns erste kompositorische Zeugnisse sind ab ca. 1900 überliefert. Vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg beschäftigte er sich\n    zunächst mit frei-‚atonalen‘ Kompositionen, in den 1920er Jahren entwickelte er dann eine spezifische, radikal\n    konzentrierte Form der Zwölftontechnik. Sein Œuvre umfasst von ihm selbst so benannte 31 Opuswerke aus den Jahren\n    1908–1944 (vorwiegend bei der Universal Edition veröffentlicht, ab op. 29: posthum publiziert), darüber hinaus\n    Bearbeitungen eigener und fremder Werke sowie weitere Kompositionen (teils posthum publiziert) und Skizzen.\n\n\n\n    Mit seiner Frau Wilhelmine (Minna), geb.

Schlagworthafte Kurzinformationen zu relevanten Personen dienen der    besseren Übersicht über Kontakte und das soziale Umfeld des Komponisten.Kurz-Biographie    Am 3. Dezember 1883 in Wien geboren, wuchs Anton Webern in Wien, Graz und Klagenfurt sowie auf dem väterlichen Gut    Preglhof in Kärnten auf. In Klagenfurt, wo er auch das humanistische Gymnasium besuchte, erhielt er seine erste    musikalische und musiktheoretische Ausbildung und sammelte praktische Erfahrung als Cellist im örtlichen    Konzertvereinsorchester. Ab dem Herbstsemester 1902 studierte Webern Musikwissenschaft im von Guido Adler geleiteten    musikwissenschaftlichen Institut in Wien, wo er 1906 mit einer Dissertation zu Heinrich Isaacs    Choralis Constantinus abschloss. 1904–1908 war er Kompositionsschüler Arnold Schönbergs, dem er zeitlebens    eng verbunden blieb. Versuche einer Karriere als fest engagierter Dirigent an diversen Musiktheatern (Teplitz, Bad    Ischl, Danzig, Stettin, Prag) scheiterten.    Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg unterrichtete Webern Privatschüler in Musiktheorie und Komposition und arbeitete u. a. als    Vortragsmeister beim Verein für musikalische Privataufführungen (1918–1922), als Klavierlehrer und Chorleiter am    Israelitischen Blindeninstitut in Wien (1925–1931) oder übernahm (in seinen letzten Lebensjahren) auch Aufgaben als    Arrangeur fremder Werke für die Universal Edition.    Als Dirigent verschiedenster Chöre und Orchester (z. B. des Wiener Schubertbundes, des Mödlinger    Männergesangvereins, der Arbeiter-Symphoniekonzerte der Sozialdemokratischen Kunststelle in Wien) wurde er in den    Zwanziger- und Dreissigerjahren einem breiteren Publikum bekannt. Ab 1927 dirigierte er im Wiener Rundfunk, wo er    zwischen 1930 und 1939 noch als Lektor und Zensor arbeitete. Seine Tätigkeit als Dirigent im Inland endete    allerdings 1934 nach dem Dollfuß-Putsch. Wenige Auslandsengagements führten ihn ab 1929 mehrfach nach London sowie    nach Deutschland.    Weberns erste kompositorische Zeugnisse sind ab ca. 1900 überliefert. Vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg beschäftigte er sich    zunächst mit frei-‚atonalen‘ Kompositionen, in den 1920er Jahren entwickelte er dann eine spezifische, radikal    konzentrierte Form der Zwölftontechnik. Sein Œuvre umfasst von ihm selbst so benannte 31 Opuswerke aus den Jahren    1908–1944 (vorwiegend bei der Universal Edition veröffentlicht, ab op. 29: posthum publiziert), darüber hinaus    Bearbeitungen eigener und fremder Werke sowie weitere Kompositionen (teils posthum publiziert) und Skizzen.    Mit seiner Frau Wilhelmine (Minna), geb. Mörtl, die er im Februar 1911 geheiratet hatte, und den vier Kindern    Amalie, Maria, Peter und Christine lebte Webern vorwiegend in der Umgebung Wiens, zunächst in Mödling, später in    Maria Enzersdorf. Dort verbrachte das Ehepaar Webern auch die Jahre des Zweiten Weltkriegs. Anfang April 1945    flüchteten sie nach Mittersill im Oberpinzgau, wo Anton Webern am 15. September von einem amerikanischen    Besatzungssoldaten erschossen wurde.

Während die mit einer Opuszahl versehenen Werke (op. 1–31) größtenteils noch zu Lebzeiten\n    bei der UE in Wien im Druck erschienen sind, ist ein beträchtlicher Teil des kompositorischen Nachlasses – darunter\n    zahlreiche Kompositionen aus seiner Jugend und Studienzeit, teils auch aus dem zwischen 1904 und 1908\n    stattgefundenen Unterricht bei Schönberg stammend – erst nach seinem Tod entdeckt und der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich\n    gemacht worden.\n\n\n\n    Für Recherchezwecke sind im Folgenden nach den Kategorien Opuszahl und\n    Moldenhauer-Nummer geordnete Werklisten aufrufbar, um einen\n    Überblick über Weberns Schaffen zu ermöglichen.

Maßgeblich beteiligt an Auffindung, Zusammenstellung und Erhalt dieses Nachlasses war der\n    deutsch-amerikanischer Musiker und Musikforscher Hans Moldenhauer, der in drei Etappen in den Besitz verschiedener\n    Teilnachlässe gelangte:[1] 1961 erwarb Moldenhauer von Amalie\n    Waller, der ältesten Tochter Weberns (mit der Moldenhauer im Zuge seiner Nachforschungen über Weberns Todesumstände\n    Bekanntschaft gemacht hatte), Notenmanuskripte und Tagebücher, die sich in Familienbesitz befunden hatten. Dieser\n    Teilnachlass enthielt bis dahin unbekannte Frühwerke Weberns, so unter anderem Im Sommerwind M 63, den\n    Langsamen Satz für Streichquartett M 78, das Streichquartett von 1905 M 79, das Klavierquintett M 118,\n    diverse Lieder sowie das letzte der insgesamt sechs Skizzenbücher;[2]\n    diese beinhalten umfassendes Skizzenmaterial zu den Opuswerken 17–31 und einigen anderen, unvollständigen Stücken\n    aus der Zeit ab 1925. Über den Erwerb und den Transport der Quellen in die USA, wo Moldenhauer an seinem Wohnort\n    Spokane (Washington) im Begriff war ein Quellenarchiv aufzubauen, berichtete damals auch die amerikanische Presse.[3]\n\n\n    1963 brachte Moldenhauer mittels Nachforschungen vier weitere Skizzenbücher (Nr. 2–5 mit insgesamt 422 folia) in\n    seinen Besitz, die von Amalie Waller 1954 zusammen mit anderen Materialien leihweise an Friedrich Wildgans für eine\n    geplante Biographie weggegeben worden waren.[4] 1965 führte\n    schließlich ein Treffen mit Hermine Webern, der Schwiegertochter Weberns, zu einem Fund im Dachboden ihres\n    Elternhauses in Perchtoldsdorf bei Wien, wohin Teile von Weberns Nachlass nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges\n    überführt worden waren.[5] Eigentlich auf der Suche nach\n    einer zweiten von Josef Humplik[6] angefertigten und durch\n    eine Fotografie dokumentierten Bronzebüste des Komponisten stießen die beiden nicht nur auf Weberns eigenes\n    Violoncello, sondern außerdem auf drei Bündel mit Musikmanuskripten von Weberns Hand. Auch diesmal betraf der Fund\n    vorwiegend das Frühschaffen: Neben etlichen Liedern aus der Jugendzeit und der frühesten bekannten Komposition, den\n    zwei 1899 vermutlich für eine eigene Aufführung komponierten Stücken für Violoncello und Klavier M 1–2, befanden\n    sich unter diesen Handschriften mehrere Konvolute mit Arbeiten aus Weberns Unterrichtszeit bei Schönberg. Darüber\n    hinaus kamen Skizzen und Entwürfe aus der Zeit der freien Atonalität (u. a. „O sanftes Glühn der Berge“ M 184,\n    Cello-Sonate M 202), atonale Entwürfe von 1924/25 (u. a. die zwei Streichtrios M 273, M 278 und das\n    Kinderstück M 267) sowie Bearbeitungen eigener Werke, wie etwa eine kammermusikalische Fassung der\n    Orchesterstücke op. 6, zum Vorschein.\n\n\n    Ein Katalog der von Moldenhauer zusammengetragenen Teilnachlässe, die neben den Musikmanuskripten auch Briefe,\n    Schriften, Fotografien, Bücher und sonstige Erinnerungsstücke umfassen, wurde 1966 erstmals publiziert.[7]\n\n\n    1984 gelangte Moldenhauers Webern-Sammlung zum größten Teil in den Besitz der Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basel, wo sie\n    in den nachfolgenden Jahren um weitere Handschriften, Briefe und andere Dokumente sowohl aus den Moldenhauer\n    Archives als auch aus anderen privaten Beständen erweitert wurde. Diese Sammlung umfasst inzwischen etliche tausend\n    Seiten an Musik- und Textmanuskripten sowie Korrespondenz, Lebensdokumente, Konzertprogramme, Rezensionen und\n    andere.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        [1]&nbsp;Moldenhauer hat über das Zustandekommen seiner Webern-Sammlung mehrfach und teilweise abweichend\n            berichtet.&nbsp;Vgl. dazu u. a.

Über den Erwerb und den Transport der Quellen in die USA, wo Moldenhauer an seinem Wohnort    Spokane (Washington) im Begriff war ein Quellenarchiv aufzubauen, berichtete damals auch die amerikanische Presse.[3]    1963 brachte Moldenhauer mittels Nachforschungen vier weitere Skizzenbücher (Nr. 2–5 mit insgesamt 422 folia) in    seinen Besitz, die von Amalie Waller 1954 zusammen mit anderen Materialien leihweise an Friedrich Wildgans für eine    geplante Biographie weggegeben worden waren.[4] 1965 führte    schließlich ein Treffen mit Hermine Webern, der Schwiegertochter Weberns, zu einem Fund im Dachboden ihres    Elternhauses in Perchtoldsdorf bei Wien, wohin Teile von Weberns Nachlass nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges    überführt worden waren.[5] Eigentlich auf der Suche nach    einer zweiten von Josef Humplik[6] angefertigten und durch    eine Fotografie dokumentierten Bronzebüste des Komponisten stießen die beiden nicht nur auf Weberns eigenes    Violoncello, sondern außerdem auf drei Bündel mit Musikmanuskripten von Weberns Hand. Auch diesmal betraf der Fund    vorwiegend das Frühschaffen: Neben etlichen Liedern aus der Jugendzeit und der frühesten bekannten Komposition, den    zwei 1899 vermutlich für eine eigene Aufführung komponierten Stücken für Violoncello und Klavier M 1–2, befanden    sich unter diesen Handschriften mehrere Konvolute mit Arbeiten aus Weberns Unterrichtszeit bei Schönberg. Darüber    hinaus kamen Skizzen und Entwürfe aus der Zeit der freien Atonalität (u. a. „O sanftes Glühn der Berge“ M 184,    Cello-Sonate M 202), atonale Entwürfe von 1924/25 (u. a. die zwei Streichtrios M 273, M 278 und das    Kinderstück M 267) sowie Bearbeitungen eigener Werke, wie etwa eine kammermusikalische Fassung der    Orchesterstücke op. 6, zum Vorschein.    Ein Katalog der von Moldenhauer zusammengetragenen Teilnachlässe, die neben den Musikmanuskripten auch Briefe,    Schriften, Fotografien, Bücher und sonstige Erinnerungsstücke umfassen, wurde 1966 erstmals publiziert.[7]    1984 gelangte Moldenhauers Webern-Sammlung zum größten Teil in den Besitz der Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basel, wo sie    in den nachfolgenden Jahren um weitere Handschriften, Briefe und andere Dokumente sowohl aus den Moldenhauer    Archives als auch aus anderen privaten Beständen erweitert wurde. Diese Sammlung umfasst inzwischen etliche tausend    Seiten an Musik- und Textmanuskripten sowie Korrespondenz, Lebensdokumente, Konzertprogramme, Rezensionen und    andere.                [1] Moldenhauer hat über das Zustandekommen seiner Webern-Sammlung mehrfach und teilweise abweichend            berichtet. Vgl. dazu u. a.
