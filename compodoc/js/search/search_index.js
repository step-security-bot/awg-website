B. mit Arnold Schönberg, Alban Berg, seiner Librettistin der späteren    Jahre Hildegard Jone, mit Heinrich Jalowetz oder mit der Universal Edition - wird auch sein Schriftverkehr mit    zahlreichen weiteren Personen so umfänglich wie möglich erfasst.    Auf SALSAH wird jedes Dokument einzeln katalogisiert. Zu jedem solchen Objekt sind für den Nutzer Kurzinformationen    (Adressat, Absender, Datum, Ort, Incipit, Kurzinhalt) abrufbar. Die Suche ist nach verschiedenen Parametern    eingrenzbar (z. B. Korrespondenzpartnern, Datum).

Dezember 1883 in Wien geboren, wuchs Anton Webern in Wien, Graz und Klagenfurt sowie auf dem väterlichen Gut\n    Preglhof in Kärnten auf. In Klagenfurt, wo er auch das humanistische Gymnasium besuchte, erhielt er seine erste\n    musikalische und musiktheoretische Ausbildung und sammelte praktische Erfahrung als Cellist im örtlichen\n    Konzertvereinsorchester. Ab dem Herbstsemester 1902 studierte Webern Musikwissenschaft im von Guido Adler geleiteten\n    musikwissenschaftlichen Institut in Wien, wo er 1906 mit einer Dissertation zu Heinrich Isaacs\n    Choralis Constantinus abschloss. 1904–1908 war er Kompositionsschüler Arnold Schönbergs, dem er zeitlebens\n    eng verbunden blieb. Versuche einer Karriere als fest engagierter Dirigent an diversen Musiktheatern (Teplitz, Bad\n    Ischl, Danzig, Stettin, Prag) scheiterten.\n\n\n\n    Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg unterrichtete Webern Privatschüler in Musiktheorie und Komposition und arbeitete u. a. als\n    Vortragsmeister beim Verein für musikalische Privataufführungen (1918–1922), als Klavierlehrer und Chorleiter am\n    Israelitischen Blindeninstitut in Wien (1925–1931) oder übernahm (in seinen letzten Lebensjahren) auch Aufgaben als\n    Arrangeur fremder Werke für die Universal Edition.\n\n\n\n    Als Dirigent verschiedenster Chöre und Orchester (z. B. des Wiener Schubertbundes, des Mödlinger\n    Männergesangvereins, der Arbeiter-Symphoniekonzerte der Sozialdemokratischen Kunststelle in Wien) wurde er in den\n    Zwanziger- und Dreissigerjahren einem breiteren Publikum bekannt. Ab 1927 dirigierte er im Wiener Rundfunk, wo er\n    zwischen 1930 und 1939 noch als Lektor und Zensor arbeitete. Seine Tätigkeit als Dirigent im Inland endete\n    allerdings 1934 nach dem Dollfuß-Putsch. Wenige Auslandsengagements führten ihn ab 1929 mehrfach nach London sowie\n    nach Deutschland.\n\n\n\n    Weberns erste kompositorische Zeugnisse sind ab ca. 1900 überliefert. Vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg beschäftigte er sich\n    zunächst mit frei-‚atonalen‘ Kompositionen, in den 1920er Jahren entwickelte er dann eine spezifische, radikal\n    konzentrierte Form der Zwölftontechnik. Sein Œuvre umfasst von ihm selbst so benannte 31 Opuswerke aus den Jahren\n    1908–1944 (vorwiegend bei der Universal Edition veröffentlicht, ab op. 29: posthum publiziert), darüber hinaus\n    Bearbeitungen eigener und fremder Werke sowie weitere Kompositionen (teils posthum publiziert) und Skizzen.\n\n\n\n    Mit seiner Frau Wilhelmine (Minna), geb. Mörtl, die er im Februar 1911 geheiratet hatte, und den vier Kindern\n    Amalie, Maria, Peter und Christine lebte Webern vorwiegend in der Umgebung Wiens, zunächst in Mödling, später in\n    Maria Enzersdorf. Dort verbrachte das Ehepaar Webern auch die Jahre des Zweiten Weltkriegs. Anfang April 1945\n    flüchteten sie nach Mittersill im Oberpinzgau, wo Anton Webern am 15.

Werken geordnet nach ihrer Moldenhauer-Nummer. Moldenhauer erstellte ein chronologisches\n    Werkverzeichnis und ordnete (mit einigen Ausnahmen) jedem ihm bekannten Einzelstück, gleich ob Bestandteil eines\n    mehrsätzigen Werkes oder separat für sich stehend, eine Nummer zu. Die AWG hat trotz vereinzelter Zweifel an der\n    chronologischen Richtigkeit diese Nummerierung als Basis bei der Strukturierung von Weberns kompositorischem Œuvre\n    übernommen, erweitert oder modifiziert sie jedoch bei Bedarf. Von Moldenhauer nicht erfassten Stücken ordnet die AWG\n    ungeachtet der Chronologie eine neue Nummer zu. Diese neu vergebenen Nummern beginnen zur klaren Abgrenzung von den\n    ursprünglichen 347 Moldenhauer-Nummern ab der Nummer 400.\n\n\n\n    Zu jeder Nummer findet sich ein Eintrag mit kurzen Informationen zu Entstehung, gegebenenfalls Uraufführung und/oder\n    Drucklegung eines Stücks sowie eine Quellenübersicht.

Moldenhauer erstellte ein chronologisches    Werkverzeichnis und ordnete (mit einigen Ausnahmen) jedem ihm bekannten Einzelstück, gleich ob Bestandteil eines    mehrsätzigen Werkes oder separat für sich stehend, eine Nummer zu. Die AWG hat trotz vereinzelter Zweifel an der    chronologischen Richtigkeit diese Nummerierung als Basis bei der Strukturierung von Weberns kompositorischem Œuvre    übernommen, erweitert oder modifiziert sie jedoch bei Bedarf. Von Moldenhauer nicht erfassten Stücken ordnet die AWG    ungeachtet der Chronologie eine neue Nummer zu. Diese neu vergebenen Nummern beginnen zur klaren Abgrenzung von den    ursprünglichen 347 Moldenhauer-Nummern ab der Nummer 400.    Zu jeder Nummer findet sich ein Eintrag mit kurzen Informationen zu Entstehung, gegebenenfalls Uraufführung und/oder    Drucklegung eines Stücks sowie eine Quellenübersicht.

Verweise auf einen größeren Kontext innerhalb von    Werkzusammenhängen, Fassungen oder Ähnlichem werden durch Verknüpfungen angezeigt (dieser Bereich befindet sich im    Aufbau und wird laufend erweitert und ergänzt).

Anton Weberns Œuvre beinhaltet neben einigen orchestralen Werken hauptsächlich Lieder und Kammermusik in\n    verschiedenster Besetzung. Während die mit einer Opuszahl versehenen Werke (op. 1–31) größtenteils noch zu Lebzeiten\n    bei der UE in Wien im Druck erschienen sind, ist ein beträchtlicher Teil des kompositorischen Nachlasses – darunter\n    zahlreiche Kompositionen aus seiner Jugend und Studienzeit, teils auch aus dem zwischen 1904 und 1908\n    stattgefundenen Unterricht bei Schönberg stammend – erst nach seinem Tod entdeckt und der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich\n    gemacht worden.\n\n\n\n    Für Recherchezwecke sind im Folgenden nach den Kategorien Opuszahl und\n    Moldenhauer-Nummer geordnete Werklisten aufrufbar, um einen\n    Überblick über Weberns Schaffen zu ermöglichen. Zu jedem Eintrag einer Liste bietet die Plattform SALSAH kurze\n    Informationen zu Entstehung, gegebenenfalls Uraufführung und/oder Drucklegung eines Stücks sowie eine\n    Quellenübersicht. Verweise auf einen größeren Kontext innerhalb von Werkzusammenhängen, Fassungen oder Ähnlichem\n    werden durch Verknüpfungen angezeigt.\n\n\nAnton Weberns kompositorischer Nachlass\n\n    Dass von Anton Webern überhaupt ein kompositorischer Nachlass existiert, wurde der Öffentlichkeit erst ab den 1960er\n    Jahren allmählich bekannt. Maßgeblich beteiligt an Auffindung, Zusammenstellung und Erhalt dieses Nachlasses war der\n    deutsch-amerikanischer Musiker und Musikforscher Hans Moldenhauer, der in drei Etappen in den Besitz verschiedener\n    Teilnachlässe gelangte: 1961 erwarb Moldenhauer von Amalie Waller, der ältesten Tochter Weberns (mit der Moldenhauer\n    im Zuge seiner Nachforschungen über Weberns Todesumstände Bekanntschaft gemacht hatte), Notenmanuskripte und\n    Tagebücher, die sich in ihrem Besitz befunden hatten.[1]\n    Dieser Teilnachlass enthielt bis dahin unbekannte Frühwerke Weberns, so unter anderem Siegfrieds Schwert M\n    16, Im Sommerwind M 63, den Langsamen Satz für Streichquartett M 78, das Streichquartett M 79 von\n    1905, das Klavierquintett M 118, diverse Lieder sowie das letzte der insgesamt sechs Skizzenbücher,[2]\n    die umfassendes Skizzenmaterial zu den Opuswerken 17–31 und einigen anderen, unvollständigen Stücken aus der Zeit ab\n    1925 beinhalten. Über den Erwerb und den Transport der Quellen nach Spokane in Washington, wo Moldenhauer an seinem\n    Wohnort im Begriff war ein Quellenarchiv aufzubauen, berichtete damals sogar die amerikanische Presse.[3]\n\n\n    1963 brachte Moldenhauer mittels Nachforschungen vier weitere Skizzenbücher (Nr. 2–5 mit insgesamt 422 folia) in\n    seinen Besitz, die von Amalie Waller 1954 zusammen mit anderen Materialien leihweise an einen Wiener Musik er für\n    eine geplante Biographie weggegeben worden waren.[4] Am 26.\n    Oktober 1965 führte schließlich ein Treffen mit Hermine Webern, der Schwiegertochter Weberns, zu einem Fund im\n    Dachboden ihres Elternhauses in Perchtoldsdorf bei Wien, wohin Teile von Weberns Nachlass nach dem Ende des Zweiten\n    Weltkrieges überführt worden waren. [5] Eigentlich auf der\n    Suche nach einer zweiten von Josef Humplik[6] angefertigten\n    und durch eine Fotografie dokumentierten Bronzebüste des Komponisten stießen die beiden nicht nur auf Weberns\n    eigenes Violoncello, sondern außerdem auf drei in einen Umschlag gepackte Bündel mit Musikmanuskripten von Weberns\n    Hand. Auch diesmal betraf der Fund vorwiegend das Frühschaffen: Neben etlichen Liedern aus der Jugendzeit und der\n    frühesten bekannten Komposition, den zwei 1899 vermutlich für eine eigene Aufführung komponierten Stücken für\n    Violoncello und Klavier M 1–2, befanden sich unter diesen Handschriften mehrere Konvolute mit Arbeiten aus Weberns\n    Unterrichtszeit bei Arnold Schönberg von 1904 bis 1908. Darüber hinaus kamen Skizzen und Entwürfe aus der Zeit der\n    freien Atonalität von 1908 bis 1914 (u. a. „O sanftes Glühn der Berge“ M 184, Cello-Sonate M 202), atonale Entwürfe\n    von 1924/25 (u. a. die zwei Streichtrios M 273, M 278 und das Kinderstück M 267) sowie Bearbeitungen\n    eigener Werke, wie etwa eine kammermusikalische Fassung der Orchesterstücke op. 6, zum Vorschein.\n\n\n    Ein Katalog der von Moldenhauer zusammengetragenen Teilnachlässe, die neben den Musikmanuskripten auch Briefe,\n    Schriften, Fotografien, Bücher und sonstige Erinnerungsstücke umfassen, wurde 1966 erstmals publiziert.[7]\n\n\n    1984 gelangte Moldenhauers Sammlung zum größten Teil in den Besitz der Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basel, wo sie in den\n    nachfolgenden Jahren um weitere Handschriften und Briefe sowohl aus den Moldenhauer Archives als auch aus anderen\n    Archiven oder privaten Beständen erweitert wurde. Diese Sammlung umfasst inzwischen etliche tausend Seiten an Musik-\n    und Textmanuskripten sowie Korrespondenz, Konzertprogramme und andere Dokumente.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        [1]&nbsp;Hans Moldenhauer,\n        Anton von Webern.

Während die mit einer Opuszahl versehenen Werke (op. 1–31) größtenteils noch zu Lebzeiten    bei der UE in Wien im Druck erschienen sind, ist ein beträchtlicher Teil des kompositorischen Nachlasses – darunter    zahlreiche Kompositionen aus seiner Jugend und Studienzeit, teils auch aus dem zwischen 1904 und 1908    stattgefundenen Unterricht bei Schönberg stammend – erst nach seinem Tod entdeckt und der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich    gemacht worden.    Für Recherchezwecke sind im Folgenden nach den Kategorien Opuszahl und    Moldenhauer-Nummer geordnete Werklisten aufrufbar, um einen    Überblick über Weberns Schaffen zu ermöglichen. Zu jedem Eintrag einer Liste bietet die Plattform SALSAH kurze    Informationen zu Entstehung, gegebenenfalls Uraufführung und/oder Drucklegung eines Stücks sowie eine    Quellenübersicht. Verweise auf einen größeren Kontext innerhalb von Werkzusammenhängen, Fassungen oder Ähnlichem    werden durch Verknüpfungen angezeigt.Anton Weberns kompositorischer Nachlass    Dass von Anton Webern überhaupt ein kompositorischer Nachlass existiert, wurde der Öffentlichkeit erst ab den 1960er    Jahren allmählich bekannt. Maßgeblich beteiligt an Auffindung, Zusammenstellung und Erhalt dieses Nachlasses war der    deutsch-amerikanischer Musiker und Musikforscher Hans Moldenhauer, der in drei Etappen in den Besitz verschiedener    Teilnachlässe gelangte: 1961 erwarb Moldenhauer von Amalie Waller, der ältesten Tochter Weberns (mit der Moldenhauer    im Zuge seiner Nachforschungen über Weberns Todesumstände Bekanntschaft gemacht hatte), Notenmanuskripte und    Tagebücher, die sich in ihrem Besitz befunden hatten.[1]    Dieser Teilnachlass enthielt bis dahin unbekannte Frühwerke Weberns, so unter anderem Siegfrieds Schwert M    16, Im Sommerwind M 63, den Langsamen Satz für Streichquartett M 78, das Streichquartett M 79 von    1905, das Klavierquintett M 118, diverse Lieder sowie das letzte der insgesamt sechs Skizzenbücher,[2]    die umfassendes Skizzenmaterial zu den Opuswerken 17–31 und einigen anderen, unvollständigen Stücken aus der Zeit ab    1925 beinhalten. Über den Erwerb und den Transport der Quellen nach Spokane in Washington, wo Moldenhauer an seinem    Wohnort im Begriff war ein Quellenarchiv aufzubauen, berichtete damals sogar die amerikanische Presse.[3]    1963 brachte Moldenhauer mittels Nachforschungen vier weitere Skizzenbücher (Nr. 2–5 mit insgesamt 422 folia) in    seinen Besitz, die von Amalie Waller 1954 zusammen mit anderen Materialien leihweise an einen Wiener Musik er für    eine geplante Biographie weggegeben worden waren.[4] Am 26.    Oktober 1965 führte schließlich ein Treffen mit Hermine Webern, der Schwiegertochter Weberns, zu einem Fund im    Dachboden ihres Elternhauses in Perchtoldsdorf bei Wien, wohin Teile von Weberns Nachlass nach dem Ende des Zweiten    Weltkrieges überführt worden waren. [5] Eigentlich auf der    Suche nach einer zweiten von Josef Humplik[6] angefertigten    und durch eine Fotografie dokumentierten Bronzebüste des Komponisten stießen die beiden nicht nur auf Weberns    eigenes Violoncello, sondern außerdem auf drei in einen Umschlag gepackte Bündel mit Musikmanuskripten von Weberns    Hand. Auch diesmal betraf der Fund vorwiegend das Frühschaffen: Neben etlichen Liedern aus der Jugendzeit und der    frühesten bekannten Komposition, den zwei 1899 vermutlich für eine eigene Aufführung komponierten Stücken für    Violoncello und Klavier M 1–2, befanden sich unter diesen Handschriften mehrere Konvolute mit Arbeiten aus Weberns    Unterrichtszeit bei Arnold Schönberg von 1904 bis 1908. Darüber hinaus kamen Skizzen und Entwürfe aus der Zeit der    freien Atonalität von 1908 bis 1914 (u. a. „O sanftes Glühn der Berge“ M 184, Cello-Sonate M 202), atonale Entwürfe    von 1924/25 (u. a. die zwei Streichtrios M 273, M 278 und das Kinderstück M 267) sowie Bearbeitungen    eigener Werke, wie etwa eine kammermusikalische Fassung der Orchesterstücke op. 6, zum Vorschein.    Ein Katalog der von Moldenhauer zusammengetragenen Teilnachlässe, die neben den Musikmanuskripten auch Briefe,    Schriften, Fotografien, Bücher und sonstige Erinnerungsstücke umfassen, wurde 1966 erstmals publiziert.[7]    1984 gelangte Moldenhauers Sammlung zum größten Teil in den Besitz der Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basel, wo sie in den    nachfolgenden Jahren um weitere Handschriften und Briefe sowohl aus den Moldenhauer Archives als auch aus anderen    Archiven oder privaten Beständen erweitert wurde. Diese Sammlung umfasst inzwischen etliche tausend Seiten an Musik-    und Textmanuskripten sowie Korrespondenz, Konzertprogramme und andere Dokumente.
