In Klagenfurt, wo er auch das humanistische Gymnasium besuchte, erhielt er seine erste\n    musikalische und musiktheoretische Ausbildung und sammelte praktische Erfahrung als Cellist im örtlichen\n    Konzertvereinsorchester. Ab dem Herbstsemester 1902 studierte Webern Musikwissenschaft im von Guido Adler geleiteten\n    musikwissenschaftlichen Institut in Wien, wo er 1906 mit einer Dissertation zu Heinrich Isaacs\n    Choralis Constantinus abschloss. 1904–1908 war er Kompositionsschüler Arnold Schönbergs, dem er zeitlebens\n    eng verbunden blieb. Versuche einer Karriere als fest engagierter Dirigent an diversen Musiktheatern (Teplitz, Bad\n    Ischl, Danzig, Stettin, Prag) scheiterten.\n\n\n\n    Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg unterrichtete Webern Privatschüler in Musiktheorie und Komposition und arbeitete u. a. als\n    Vortragsmeister beim Verein für musikalische Privataufführungen (1918–1922), als Klavierlehrer und Chorleiter am\n    Israelitischen Blindeninstitut in Wien (1925–1931) oder übernahm (in seinen letzten Lebensjahren) auch Aufgaben als\n    Arrangeur fremder Werke für die Universal Edition.\n\n\n\n    Als Dirigent verschiedenster Chöre und Orchester (z. B. des Wiener Schubertbundes, des Mödlinger\n    Männergesangvereins, der Arbeiter-Symphoniekonzerte der Sozialdemokratischen Kunststelle in Wien) wurde er in den\n    Zwanziger- und Dreissigerjahren einem breiteren Publikum bekannt. Ab 1927 dirigierte er im Wiener Rundfunk, wo er\n    zwischen 1930 und 1939 noch als Lektor und Zensor arbeitete. Seine Tätigkeit als Dirigent im Inland endete\n    allerdings 1934 nach dem Dollfuß-Putsch. Wenige Auslandsengagements führten ihn ab 1929 mehrfach nach London sowie\n    nach Deutschland.\n\n\n\n    Weberns erste kompositorische Zeugnisse sind ab ca. 1900 überliefert. Vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg beschäftigte er sich\n    zunächst mit frei-‚atonalen‘ Kompositionen, in den 1920er Jahren entwickelte er dann eine spezifische, radikal\n    konzentrierte Form der Zwölftontechnik. Sein Œuvre umfasst von ihm selbst so benannte 31 Opuswerke aus den Jahren\n    1908–1944 (vorwiegend bei der Universal Edition veröffentlicht, ab op. 29: posthum publiziert), darüber hinaus\n    Bearbeitungen eigener und fremder Werke sowie weitere Kompositionen (teils posthum publiziert) und Skizzen.\n\n\n\n    Mit seiner Frau Wilhelmine (Minna), geb. Mörtl, die er im Februar 1911 geheiratet hatte, und den vier Kindern\n    Amalie, Maria, Peter und Christine lebte Webern vorwiegend in der Umgebung Wiens, zunächst in Mödling, später in\n    Maria Enzersdorf. Dort verbrachte das Ehepaar Webern auch die Jahre des Zweiten Weltkriegs. Anfang April 1945\n    flüchteten sie nach Mittersill im Oberpinzgau, wo Anton Webern am 15. September von einem amerikanischen\n    Besatzungssoldaten erschossen wurde.\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        Anton Webern mit seiner Frau Minna und Tochter Mali, 1912 (Wienbibliothek im Rathaus).\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n        Webern als Soldat mit Tochter Mali, 1915 (Wienbibliothek im Rathaus).\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n        Webern bei einem Chorausflug, um 1925 (Wienbibliothek im Rathaus).\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n        Webern als Dirigent, 1933 (Wienbibliothek im Rathaus).\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n        Webern 1935 (Wienbibliothek im Rathaus).\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n                \n                    ./webern-overview.component.css\n                \n                \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                Legend\n            \n            \n                Html element\n            \n            \n                Component\n            \n            \n                Html element with directive\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        var COMPONENT_TEMPLATE = '    Die Anton Webern Gesamtausgabe erarbeitet im Zuge der Edition sämtlicher Kompositionen Anton Weberns eine möglichst    lückenlose Dokumentation einerseits der Biographie des Komponisten, andererseits der Entstehungs-, Publikations- und    Aufführungsgeschichte seiner Werke.

Seine Tätigkeit als Dirigent im Inland endete    allerdings 1934 nach dem Dollfuß-Putsch. Wenige Auslandsengagements führten ihn ab 1929 mehrfach nach London sowie    nach Deutschland.    Weberns erste kompositorische Zeugnisse sind ab ca. 1900 überliefert. Vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg beschäftigte er sich    zunächst mit frei-‚atonalen‘ Kompositionen, in den 1920er Jahren entwickelte er dann eine spezifische, radikal    konzentrierte Form der Zwölftontechnik. Sein Œuvre umfasst von ihm selbst so benannte 31 Opuswerke aus den Jahren    1908–1944 (vorwiegend bei der Universal Edition veröffentlicht, ab op. 29: posthum publiziert), darüber hinaus    Bearbeitungen eigener und fremder Werke sowie weitere Kompositionen (teils posthum publiziert) und Skizzen.    Mit seiner Frau Wilhelmine (Minna), geb. Mörtl, die er im Februar 1911 geheiratet hatte, und den vier Kindern    Amalie, Maria, Peter und Christine lebte Webern vorwiegend in der Umgebung Wiens, zunächst in Mödling, später in    Maria Enzersdorf. Dort verbrachte das Ehepaar Webern auch die Jahre des Zweiten Weltkriegs. Anfang April 1945    flüchteten sie nach Mittersill im Oberpinzgau, wo Anton Webern am 15. September von einem amerikanischen    Besatzungssoldaten erschossen wurde.

Maßgeblich beteiligt an Auffindung, Zusammenstellung und Erhalt dieses Nachlasses war der\n    deutsch-amerikanischer Musiker und Musikforscher Hans Moldenhauer, der in drei Etappen in den Besitz verschiedener\n    Teilnachlässe gelangte: 1961 erwarb Moldenhauer von Amalie Waller, der ältesten Tochter Weberns (mit der Moldenhauer\n    im Zuge seiner Nachforschungen über Weberns Todesumstände Bekanntschaft gemacht hatte), Notenmanuskripte und\n    Tagebücher, die sich in ihrem Besitz befunden hatten.[1]\n    Dieser Teilnachlass enthielt bis dahin unbekannte Frühwerke Weberns, so unter anderem Siegfrieds Schwert M\n    16, Im Sommerwind M 63, den Langsamen Satz für Streichquartett M 78, das Streichquartett M 79 von\n    1905, das Klavierquintett M 118, diverse Lieder sowie das letzte der insgesamt sechs Skizzenbücher,[2]\n    die umfassendes Skizzenmaterial zu den Opuswerken 17–31 und einigen anderen, unvollständigen Stücken aus der Zeit ab\n    1925 beinhalten. Über den Erwerb und den Transport der Quellen nach Spokane in Washington, wo Moldenhauer an seinem\n    Wohnort im Begriff war ein Quellenarchiv aufzubauen, berichtete damals sogar die amerikanische Presse.[3]\n\n\n    1963 brachte Moldenhauer mittels Nachforschungen vier weitere Skizzenbücher (Nr. 2–5 mit insgesamt 422 folia) in\n    seinen Besitz, die von Amalie Waller 1954 zusammen mit anderen Materialien leihweise an einen Wiener Musik er für\n    eine geplante Biographie weggegeben worden waren.[4] Am 26.\n    Oktober 1965 führte schließlich ein Treffen mit Hermine Webern, der Schwiegertochter Weberns, zu einem Fund im\n    Dachboden ihres Elternhauses in Perchtoldsdorf bei Wien, wohin Teile von Weberns Nachlass nach dem Ende des Zweiten\n    Weltkrieges überführt worden waren. [5] Eigentlich auf der\n    Suche nach einer zweiten von Josef Humplik[6] angefertigten\n    und durch eine Fotografie dokumentierten Bronzebüste des Komponisten stießen die beiden nicht nur auf Weberns\n    eigenes Violoncello, sondern außerdem auf drei in einen Umschlag gepackte Bündel mit Musikmanuskripten von Weberns\n    Hand. Auch diesmal betraf der Fund vorwiegend das Frühschaffen: Neben etlichen Liedern aus der Jugendzeit und der\n    frühesten bekannten Komposition, den zwei 1899 vermutlich für eine eigene Aufführung komponierten Stücken für\n    Violoncello und Klavier M 1–2, befanden sich unter diesen Handschriften mehrere Konvolute mit Arbeiten aus Weberns\n    Unterrichtszeit bei Arnold Schönberg von 1904 bis 1908. Darüber hinaus kamen Skizzen und Entwürfe aus der Zeit der\n    freien Atonalität von 1908 bis 1914 (u. a. „O sanftes Glühn der Berge“ M 184, Cello-Sonate M 202), atonale Entwürfe\n    von 1924/25 (u. a. die zwei Streichtrios M 273, M 278 und das Kinderstück M 267) sowie Bearbeitungen\n    eigener Werke, wie etwa eine kammermusikalische Fassung der Orchesterstücke op. 6, zum Vorschein.\n\n\n    Ein Katalog der von Moldenhauer zusammengetragenen Teilnachlässe, die neben den Musikmanuskripten auch Briefe,\n    Schriften, Fotografien, Bücher und sonstige Erinnerungsstücke umfassen, wurde 1966 erstmals publiziert.[7]\n\n\n    1984 gelangte Moldenhauers Sammlung zum größten Teil in den Besitz der Paul Sacher Stiftung in Basel, wo sie in den\n    nachfolgenden Jahren um weitere Handschriften und Briefe sowohl aus den Moldenhauer Archives als auch aus anderen\n    Archiven oder privaten Beständen erweitert wurde.
